## A collaboration between programmers around the world!                                                                                                            
																																																				                                                                                                        
The ultimate goal of the PenisParser is simple, the program takes a _text_ file as input then prints the word "penis" out for every word found within the file. 
																																																																														
An example of this is as follows:

```Bash
$ ./penis input.txt
penis penis penis
```
Or the output can be put into a new text file with the original file name then followed with "_penisified".
E.g hobbit.txt ---> hobbit_penisified.txt

There is no specification on _how_ the file is parsed, as long as the output is correct and the program works.
																																																																														   
If you do not see an implementation of a language already, please feel free to add the language but create a directory for the language. _Please name the directory the language it contains_.
	
If you see an implementation of a language already but you feel you can write it better, feel free to creating a subdirectory in the language parent directory with a version tag in the name following the format of "[language]V#".
